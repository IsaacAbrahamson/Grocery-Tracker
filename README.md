This project was made for CS-210 Programming Languages.

## Reflection

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project takes a list of items and calculates how often the appear. The program then outputs a file containing the numbers as well as providing functionality to search up items and display a histogram for the frequency of items. This is useful to know how often certain foods or grocery items are purchased compared to others.

### What did you do particularly well?

I think that I've grasped the basic fundamentals of using C++ and pointers. This program is object-oriented with classes, and it also uses the C++ standard library to input and output to the command line and read and write to the file system.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I need to improve my understanding of pointers. I believe that these are one of the most useful things in C++, and understanding them is especially important for efficiency and security.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part of this was figuring out how to pass classes around by reference and pointers.  To overcome this, I had to watch some youtube videos and read several StackOverflow posts.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think the largest skill from this project will be using C++ and understanding memory. Most of my programming experience has been using high level langauges like TypeScript, so this course was a great way for me to learn more about how programming languages work. I particularly really enjoyed creating a linked list and learning more about variables and memory, because understanding how array operations affect memory has already let me write more efficient code.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This program is separated into classes and functions to be extendable and maintainable. Additionally, I provided header comments to all of the functions to easily see what they do using Intellisense.
